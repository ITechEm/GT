## My footprint in this project
This is a `full-stack` project created by dejwid and `modified by me`.

[Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/RWUgo3oeoUkHnKkPN4E1uI/QA-Delivery?node-id=0-1&t=g5JmmlmJHaZiswR4-1);
`Front-end` updated, modified and some issue fixed;
`API` Collection & Environments connected and created with Postman;
`Database` connected and created with MongoDB.

## Scope of this project

```bash
✨ Understanding front-end and back-end development better. Having a FE and a BE that communicate,
   helps me better to understand how an app works.
✨ As a QA, the best way to explain FE and BE testing to someone is by having a project with FE, API
   and DB that communicate between each other.
```

## Technology Stack and Features

```bash

｡🇯‌🇸‌‌ JavaScript for front-end and back-end
⚡ Postman for backend API
💾 MongoDB for database
💳 Stripe for payments
🎨 Figma for design
☁️ AWS-S3 for storing files
🏭 GitHub for CI/CD
🚀 Vercel for deployment and hosting

```

## Deployment

The easiest way to `deploy` my project was to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
